2022-11-10,1668041053,competency model developed with company values,"Someone pushed for me to integrate the companies competency model with the company's values. I have always been raised that values are one thing and competency models are another. I have a pseudo job analytics approach method to develop the model. I don't see how values will increase the benefits of the model.

2022-11-08,1667873399,cut-off scores,"Hey all! So I work for a tech company and I'm currently trying to put together a selection battery that includes 6 variables. SMEs have voted on cut-off scores using the Angoff method.

Our client is asking for ONE CONTINUOUS score based on one's standing across 6 variables (for ease of computing in their app). We won't be aggregating, because each variable is a discrete construct. Rather, **my intention is to compute a continuous score for each candidate that is the percentage of cutoffs cleared**. Does this appear ill-advised? Is there a better way to compute a single continuous score per candidate? 

Additionally, **if one variable was more important than another, would you recommend weighted scores in this type of situation?**",IOPsychology,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/yp87fy/cutoff_scores/
