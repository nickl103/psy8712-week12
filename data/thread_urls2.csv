Looking for resources / Best Practices around sustaining interest and actions post Behavioural assessments.

Context - I am working with their senior (N-1, N-2) Leadership development journey. We do assessments for these senior leaders to pin-point the development areas aligned to this org's competency frameworks and then a senior certified coach shares feedback and creates individual development plans - Now all of this works fine, but when it comes to creating accountability for working on their development areas we are facing a challenge. And I'm sure this is not the first project where anyone has had this issue. (We share feedback, coach is involved, actions areas are defined and leverage technology to track progress)

I am looking for cases/org cultural nuance / org process that helps organizations in driving actions among these senior leaders.",IOPsychology,5,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/135m9ga/sustained_interest_and_actions_post_behavioural/

I have had 3 roles, and each seems to go the same way. I start in the Talent COE of a large company, suppose to be leading IO projects, like data analytics, engagement surveys and assessments. Then I keep getting pulled into work outside the scope of my role. Ive never had a manager with an IO degree, so they consistently keep giving me work they dont want to do, which is outside my job description. Things like cold calling applicants as a recruiter and conducting interviews, doing SharePoint sites, developing HR trainings and events. Each year I get farther and farther away from my skills in IO areas from graduate school. I probably knew more when I was in school than I do now! 

I am consistently frustrated with the hierarchy of working in corporate, I never get to present my own work its always handed off and presented behind closed doors by my managers (who dont have my background) and then surprisingly the VPs dont have buy-in because the slides werent presented well or they couldnt answer critical questions that I had answers to. 

I think Id like to move more into consulting, like working for a company that does engagement surveys or something but I dont see any openings. And Im not even sure that would solve the issues.

I have a lot of questions around what I should be looking for - everyone seems to have their own key line or way to describe this field. What employers are looking for graduates with this degree, what should I be doing to find these employers, and how can I further position myself to be able to land a job when I graduate in November? I have been thinking about getting a temp role or internship in the meantime - and have similar questions about where to find employers that I can help and learn from",IOPsychology,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/14944u1/soon_to_be_msc_business_psychology_graduate/

I am part of a task force within my large (~4,000 employees) company to seek out avenues to improve employee engagement. We have broadly researched outside HR Specialists/Consultants, but are trying to narrow down our path forward. Currently, we perform an employee engagement survey once per year, but results are simply passed along by the survey provider for us to interpret on our own. The questions are identical for all companies that the survey is provided to, so some of the questions are confusing or not applicable to our business. This makes it difficult to actually act on results.

We are ideally looking for something more robust that may provide us with custom questions tailored to our business, along with analysis of the results and recommendations for improving engagement based on results. 

I know this is vague and a very broad question, but what would your recommendations be? Any companies or programs specifically that you would recommend reaching out to?",IOPsychology,26,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/146wz03/employee_engagement_in_large_company/

So. Essentially, we are surveying 9 different populations. 

I want to be able to show statistical changes over time for each population since the annual survey. I want to be able to infer the population from the pulse results. 


I was under the impression thst I would do a power analysis to determine this and that setting the power to . 08 is mostly standard, setting the effect to .5 is good for a medium effect and setting alpha to .05. 


Do you scale the effect size for each population by the populations standard deviation? 

Or, do you just go with the effect size of .05? 

Do you run finite point correction after you complete the power analysis on the smaller populations where the sample sizes from the power analysis are actually larger then the population?",IOPsychology,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/14620ke/questions_on_determining_the_sample_sizes_for/

I am a student who just finished his undergrad with no courses in Psychology, but upon reading Psych/Sociology-related books and listening to Psychology-based people (e.g., Jordan Peterson, Adam Grant), I have come to realize that I love the Social Sciences - and especially this one - a lot.

Thus, I would like to go into a Psychology program ASAP and start my career. I am open to Clinical Psychology (I want patients) but I realize I may not be able to practice as I'd like until I get a Doctorate/PhD, so that route I can eliminate. Then, I/O Psychology seems very fun and intriguing.

So, for I/O Psychology, I found fully-online graduate programs which offer ""M.S. in Applied Psychology, Industrial/Organizational"" at Walden University and Capella University, each. I would not mind completing these as they do not require other undergrad prerequisites and can be done online, from my home state and city (where I would love to stay).

So, can you guys please give me advice on whether total online grad programs like these at Walden and Capella are fine for your future career? And, what job can I expect to get starting out right after Master's in I/O? Will this totally-online Master's degree, along with an internship, aid me in landing a good entry-level job relating to the I/O Psych field?

Please, please guide me on this. I would like to get into this field as I have really liked it and am a critical point in my life, deciding on my career.

2023-06-02,1685668276,Internships are Tough: An Overview of One Grad Student's Experience,"I've seen a few discussions come up over the course of time about internships (and found them quite insightful), and I figured I would share how my experience went as a first year grad student looking for a summer internship. 

I applied between February and early May (in hindsight, I should've started a bit earlier), and mainly focused my search in people analytics type roles, but ended up widening my standards when the fish weren't biting. I was searching both locally (major city) and for remote positions, but was unable to relocate. Over this 3 month period, I sent in a total of 51 applications. While I only got pursued with interest by 6 (12%), I was honestly pretty impressed by the overall response rate of 67%, even though 28 (54% total) application were just a rejection without an interview. I was definitely expecting to be left in the lurch (i.e., ghosted) by more than just 16 applications (31%; although for a few I never received an email, I had to check the portal. 

Of the 5 companies that I interviewed with, I went through the entire interviewing process with all (as far as I was told), and was formally rejected from 3 positions, never heard back from 1 company, and received an offer for 1 position, which I accepted.

All in all, for those in or entering similar boats, I would note the following:

* Don't give up--my internship offer came in at the absolute last hour after I had definitely given up all ounces of hope. And I still am seeing positions being posted even today, so keep on looking.
* Maximize all of your experiences--class work, work work, volunteer work, etc. I felt like a lack of relevant experience on my resume was what was really holding me back, but I think if I had thought more into projects I had worked on I could have leveraged those more.
* Don't read into every rejection--I hate the phrase ""everything happens for a reason"" but *sometimes* things do. One of the internships that I interviewed for was essentially my *dream* and when I got turned down it devastated me. Later, I ran into the would-have-been supervisor and had a poor interaction with them and all of that devastation washed away. 
* It doesn't have to be perfect--When I first started searching, I was looking for the ideal job description (ha!) because I wanted the perfect internship. Once I started widening my search and interviewing for positions that were ""less-than-ideal"" I realized how I could still apply my interests in different roles, they just weren't explicitly mentioned. And even outside of job tasks, there could be other things to learn you may not have realized. 

Good luck to y'all in your internship/job/school searches!

I'm in my late 30s, C-level executive in tech. The greatest enjoyment in my roles comes from a deep passion to understand people &amp; their motivations - team building, team dynamics, power dynamics, individual engagement and creativity, individual performance, positive psychology, conflict resolution, leadership, etc. etc.

I have done a lot of self-education on those topics and had good mentors along the way in the business world, but have never gotten any professional education. I LOVE school / learning, and have long thought about going back for a Masters.

I am unclear on the exact path here, I don't think I want to go into counseling/therapy, but I do want a stronger foundation of knowledge in the various fields of Psychology AND I would love some years of handson experience in Clinical Psychology - thought &amp; communication tools that I can bring back to the business world.

Long-term, I can see becoming an expert in some of those areas mentioned above, being an executive business consultant / executive coach, helping creating positive cultures, teams, and support individuals, bringing deep knowledge of individual psychology and team dynamics to helping create better work environments. This sounds a lot like I/O Psychology, but I'm not quite sure that's the right direction.

So I'm wondering if it makes sense to pursue a Masters and eventually a PhD/PsyD in Clinical Psychology, without the intention to go into clinical work full time in the future, with the intention of gaining knowledge &amp; skills &amp; credentials that I can bring back to the business world.

The William James PsyD program in Leadership Psychology seems very interesting to me, two questions:

\- There seems to be a lot of negative talk about these William James programs on this forum. Is that negative only in context of future Clinical/Research work, and maybe not an issue for someone who wants to go back to corporate world, or is this just a bad program?

My rough thoughts would be something like:

* intelligence is nice and all, but which test/assessment you use to assess it matters a lot, because they vary widely in quality
* legal issues related to you not having a validity study proving that this is relevant in your particular job context
* legal issues relating to discrimination
* applicant reaction/face validity

\- - -

EDIT: The responses to this question seem to roughly be:

* Some people think that testing GMA is illegal.
* Some people are concerned that a GMA test assesses the ability to take tests in addition to assessing GMA.
* Some people mentioned anecdotes of intelligent people who perform poorly at work.

2023-05-07,1683442347,Is the GRE Worth It?,"Hello!

I'm kind of in a pickle situation. 

I am currently an undergraduate living in Canada. There are a total of 5 I/O programs in the country that I've found, at least; 2 of which require GRE scores for admission.  There are 3 closest to where I live; about an hour's drive away, and the 2 that require the GRE are part of these 3.  

I am not good at standardized tests. I have just started studying for the GRE but at the rate I'm able to proceed (while trying to properly absorb the quant concepts and make time for practice questions, on top of the fact that I am not currently able to attempt them myself), I'm not even sure if I'll be sufficiently prepared by the test date. Even if I am, I'm not sure how my anxiety would play out during the test. I know I've only just started but I'm not confident at all I'll be able to get a competitive or even good grade. I am worried and alarmed at how much math I've forgotten and am struggling to pick up at a faster rate again.

I am confident in all other aspects of admission requirements.

I am definitely going to apply to all the Canadian programs (including GRE-required ones given I decide to take the GRE). I have researched and am most likely also going to apply to some USA schools that don't require the GRE, such as Illinois Tech, Baruch, and New Haven. I am also interested in applying to some UK programs.

Is the studying and cost of the GRE really worth it? Would it be in my best interest to skip the GRE and therefore only apply to schools that do not require the GRE? Or should I go through with it? 

I'm not so sure what I should do. On one hand I feel like a loser for considering giving up so soon LOL but on the other hand I struggle with mental illness and this is taking a toll on me quite a bit. I just don't feel like I'm cut out for this, maybe because I'm Canadian and therefore don't take standardized tests often at all. I may just study a bit more and see how I feel after that...

I've been meaning to switch to R from SPSS because it's now more widely used in the field and I also feel that it will be more useful for my future research work. However, I currently can't afford to learn R through a paid program or pay for learning materials. 

So my question for you folks is, do you know of any programs, videos or any other resources that are available for free, which I can use to learn R? I have no previous experience with any programming languages so a beginner's approach is what I'm looking for.

My interests are mainly inclined towards creating changes for better employee engagement, effective training programs, etc., I'm generally a 'bigger' picture person who works better when things are seen as a whole momentum, so I figured OD is the degree for me.

2023-05-02,1683043052,SEM Help,"I recently conducted a survey of graduate students that included measures of psychological needs and motivation (from SDT perspective). 

I also asked for participants self-perceived performances among a group of 9 relevant metrics (e.g. academic, research, teaching). The participants were asked to compare their performances in those areas to that of their cohort on an below to above average scale. I also included an explicit N/A option since metrics are not always relevant to each graduate studentsome grad students don't teach or some don't do research. Because this is an explicit N/A option, I don't think it is appropriate to impute a value for the students who selected it (it obviously isn't MAR or MCAR). 

Because of the explicit N/As, I am unsure how to analyze the information. Here are my current thoughts about it.

1. If I was to do an SEM connecting the motivation scale to this (subjective) performance scale, I cannot treat the variables as ordinal because then the N/As would have to be tossed or imputed. I could treat them as nominal and convert it into a set of dichotomous variables but then that feels like it is wasting the information from the ordering of response options. 

2. I thought about treating N/As as equivalent to the neutral option in the scale but I don't know how justifiable that is. Some people might select N/A for teaching performance because they haven't taught yet (and would otherwise do well at it) or some people might select N/A because they chose not to teach because they thought they wouldn't be good.

3. Another option instead of direct SEM, I could convert participant's responses on the needs or  motivation scales to the corresponding factor scores from a CFA and then do separate ordinal regressions on each performance metric. That way, people only get dropped from the metrics they selected N/A for and not the entire analysis. 

4. One last option I have thought of would be to select a subgroup of the performance metrics to get a minimal amount of dropped participants. For example, I might select academic, conference attendance, research, and teaching for PhD students and do an SEM on those participants. And then masters students I could select academic, networking. and career preparation. My concern with this is my sample size of masters students is not particularly high (around 145) and I am unsure how the subgrouping would affect the stability of the latent variable. 

I would appreciate any opinions on how to best analyze this data.

2023-09-04,1693871204,How can IO Psychology be leveraged to fight the War on Climate Change?,"EDIT: Shouldve made this post more open-ended, sorry yall.

Im a recent graduate IO practitioner who just got his first job in a Fortune 500 company after 10 months of non-stop searching. Although Im elated to be joining this team, part of me cant help but worry about the outlook for humankind due to recent climate disasters and the fact that Im selling out to make money working for an industrial polluter. I felt as though my IO program and most of my cohort were unconcerned with the existential threat that anthropogenic climate change poses for the future of HR.

I do however, fully believe that capitalisms knack for motivating creativity can be mobilized to devise innovations to solve the climate crisis. The runway for it is just long and laden with (frankly) older people in leadership positions who are divorced from this reality.

The question I propose to this forum is this: How can we as IO practitioners pivot away from purveying practices that are destructive to nature and the environment in industries that have high path dependence on fossil fuels (e.g., compensating individuals for putting profits over sustainability, hiring individuals who are not climate-conscious, training individuals to pollute blindly, and consulting with businesses to find myopic solutions to problems that wont matter if we cant breath our own planets air).",IOPsychology,16,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/16a85v2/how_can_io_psychology_be_leveraged_to_fight_the/

The agency has 10-20 incumbents/supervisors at a location convenient to me, some of whom would be interested/qualified to serve as subject matter experts, and about 50 incumbents whom I could survey too.

Given their interest and the resources available, I was considering a project that involves conducting some form of a strategic or future-oriented work analysis that would involve a) facilitating an in-person SME panel (focus group) to better represent the tasks they are asked to perform for their job and b) survey the larger group of incumbents to understand how they view these tasks as currently performed based on frequency, time, importance, etc. to how they view these tasks being performed in the next 5 to 10 years based on frequency, time, importance, etc. too. 

I understand conducting a formal work analysis can take too much time and I am wary of the limitations a small sample size poses, which is why I wanted to pose the following questions to the sub: 

1. What is the feasibility of conducting a project like this given what you know?

I guess I am asking for any tips, opinions, advice etc. for what to do now to get on the right path.
Specifically I was thinking of finishing my BA which will be in 2024 and then going on to try to find an HR position or organization effectiveness position, something along those lines while I try to get my masters. 
(I am currently working at a call center and assumed with time I could grow and attempt to work my way into an HR position - even though with my current position that feels like a far stretch)

I had also thought about online courses that Ive seen to get an IO Psych Certification, is it worth it? Should I get some form of certification to attempt to show experience or extra training towards the field bc I wont have MS for a few more years? Will jobs view a certificate as an asset to my resume even if I dont have a masters YET?

Let begin this way, I 'm studying at Peru, doing the IB program and it's my last year, My parents are both Chinese inmigrants, I have a sister as well, as the elder son of the family, I am obviouly the first one to leave school, I already got accepted by a university even though I havn't finish the IB program yet and I want to study genetic engineering and work as a geneticist.

The reason I'm exposing some of my personal information in reddit, it's because I am losing hope to everything in life, I don't know what should take as my next goal and what step I should take, I choosed bioengineering as the career because there isn't genetic in Peru, my scores at School isn't the best neither the worst, but I feel I pretty much failing to accomplish my goals, and I am trying all my best to work it out, but.... I feel I am going to give up, I am not accusing my parents for this, I just feel like they literally hate me, in comparison to my sister (Younger) they always treat me like if I were a slave, i don't know the reason behind this kind of treatment, my mom yells me 24/364, I don't want to fight in arguments with her, so I stay quiet, I hold up everything for myself, but it seems that she's never gonna finish yelling at me, I don't know what to do, I used to be a confident desition maker but I'm losing that touch, well there is much more about it which if I had to write it all, it will be endless, so if anybody willing to help me get through it, I will be glad of it, Thanks !",IOPsychology,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/159kxac/help_me_please/

I'm about to start my second year in an IO PhD program, and even though I won't graduate until 2026, I'm still thinking about potential careers once I'm done. I've had a couple of professors try to push me to go into academia, but honestly, as appealing as the idea of ""academic freedom"" and long vacations is, I'm not sure academia is the place for me - I like researching and writing, but I'm more interested in writing for the more general public rather than for academic journals, and I don't think my personality really fits within academia, or at least from the people I've met

- For those of you that went straight into an applied role, how have you found it? What do you like/dislike?

- Has anyone gone from academia to industry? What made you want to switch? What are the tradeoffs?

- This one might be tougher to answer, but has anyone from the US successfully found work abroad in IO? I speak more than one language and would like to see what the rest of the world has to offer

So being able to show this would lower barriers to more wellbeing interventions?

I find myself at a crossroads in my career and could use some guidance.

However, I strongly believe that pursuing an IO (Industrial-Organizational) degree could be the key to advancing to the next level and aligning my career with my passion for understanding human behavior.

Here's where I could use your advice. Due to personal circumstances, I am currently in between states, making it necessary for me to pursue an online degree. I would appreciate any recommendations or insights on reputable institutions or online programs that offer IO degrees. It is essential for me to find a program that provides a comprehensive curriculum and the flexibility needed for remote learning.

Considering my situation, I am wondering if any of you have suggestions on how to mitigate the impact of a lower GPA when applying for IO programs. Are there specific steps I can take, such as acquiring relevant certifications or gaining practical experience, to compensate for a less-than-ideal academic record?

2023-07-02,1688305455,what do you learn from a research paper?,"Hello,

I will be in the second year of my Ph.D. program.Looking back on my first year, I don't feel like I learned something meaningful.

I become more used to reading research papers and interpreting study results.

And now I can run multiple regression analyses, but that's it.

I feel like... I am just swimming in the middle of the pacific ocean toward unclear goals.

To apply for practitioner jobs, should I focus more on skills like Python or R rather than theoretical knowledge from research papers?

What do people learn from research papers?

Most of the time, I just skim abstracts and results except for some papers, and it feels like a little folly to exhaustively read every single paper.

I feel like skimming papers is just a waste of my time, rather than learning something new...

How can I be an expert in this field?

How can I be successful in this field?

I have identified assessment, training, and individual differences as my areas of focus.

Do you have any recommended books or papers for a good start in that area of expertise? Should I just read all the relevant papers available?

Or should I immediately purchase a DataCamp membership to further learn data analysis skills?

What would you do if you were in my position?

I would appreciate anyone who is willing to share their experience or to give me advice (and anyone who reads this post too).

2023-11-26,1701013295,"I desparately want an accademic research career, but I don't feel set up for success due to a lack of social support.","Hey all, 

I will be graduating woth my PhD in organizational psychology - which is very different from the ""hard"" sciences. I am currently on the academic job market and have been getting interviews, but I am really not enjoying the academic experience overall. 

On the one hand, this is my dream career. I am a scholar who is interested in a wide number of scholarly fields - most of which are obviously beyond my specific field (and has admittedly made this a lot harder). It really feels like there is no other jobs where I can flex my creative and academic spirit. I love research and I want to make a fruitful career where I can contribute to addressing questions that are meaniful to organizations and to society. I know that I have ideas that can do this. 

On the other hand, my experience durring grad school has been terrible. But I've spent thousands of hours working on my advisors failed projects. I was ostracized by members of my department for having broader interests than their own, and for simply struggling with developing clear research ideas very early on. Though certainly not intended to be malicious, I've also been treated poorly and then ignored and unsupported largely due to having intense depression after starting to see things go so south in my program. Between being exploited in some ways, and other projects just not working out, I don't feel set up for success in a tenure track job. 

In general, I absolutely have all of the skills to do successful research. Nonetheless, I don't feel set up for success because I completely lack a supportive co-author team to help me get my works published. In my experience (and even that of my peers who have gone into R1 research positions) it really feels like thep only way to be successful in this job is to do it entirely alone - co-authors are only helpful durring the review process. Sure, it took me a while to reify my ideas and I certainly need more help in doing so, but I can't do this job entirely alone. 

Mind you that I am not the only person working woth my advisor and department who was not set up for success given the COVID cohorts. Our department has a strong history of developing successful academics and I am super privlidged to be in sich a resource rich environment with very successful scholar.  However, now the professors are all full profs and are relying on grad students to drive all of their projects. 

I love this job more than anything. I really felt that academia could be a place where I could thrive. I also thought it would be a place that would appreciate my broad palate if interests, and I thought that it would be a relatively safe place with pretty low stakes when it comes to making honest and human mistakes. My experience has been absolutely the opposite. 

I have given everything I have durring graduate school. I worked so hard. But I also have very bad depression, which is both due to my predisposition and due to being systematically undermined by my advisor and belittled by faculty broadly. 

Right now I am looking at R3 jobs that will likely inundate me with teaching. I love teaching, but I also love research. I'm burnt out and feel awful about myself and my work. I feel like my grad experience was terrible, I am not set up for success, and I am masochisticly trying to continue to follow my dream. Yet, though my wife is highly supportive of me, I am also risking uprooting our whole life to pursue a toxic dream. 

I want nothing more in the world but to pursue this job, but it hurts so much. Yet, I also don't feel safe moving into industry. Accademia is toxic, but many organizations are too. In general, people like working with me. Yet my depression, being gasslighted, and having a history of knowing some really toxic executives makes me very cynical about my life being any better in practice. 

I really don't know what to do. Should I accept academic jobs in a place that I dont really want to live and work? Should I continue an accademic job that may just perpetuate this trauma because accademia is not safe? Should I give up on this dream and take a job in industry... which may not be better? I feel like all I have are bad options in front of me and I don't know what to do.",IOPsychology,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/184devs/i_desparately_want_an_accademic_research_career/

Same question for the degree: I was thinking that having a double major in relevant fields might help my chances but even to have business as a another degree incase I change my mind about I/O psych in the future. Does anyone have insight into this?
3. What is the outlook for international students/Non-US citizens to land roles in I/O psychology after a grad degree? Or to even find smaller, related roles right out of undergrad?
4. What do the exit opportunities look like after being in the field for a while?
5. Even with this degree, I want to earn certifications or learn other skills on the side. What types of skills should I try to learn that will help me for I/O psych?
6. Lastly, what specialization in the business degree would you recommend for me to pursue for an I/O psych boost, but also just in general incase I/O does not work for me?: Finance, Information Systems, Marketing, Economics. (Consider Job outlook and salary for these fields)

I am asking for some advice or resources for which I may not be aware of regarding my job search. I graduated in may of 2022 with a masters degree in IO psychology in the New York area from a brick and mortar institution. 

Before graduating I went to career services and had appointments with them to prepare for interviews and get my resume reviewed. It was helpful and the resume review checked out. I also started the search early about 3-6 months before graduating. 

Within 3 months of graduating I probably interviewed with around 8-10 different organizations related to IO psych or entry level HR positions but was never offered a position. 

After the initial 3 months post grad, I stagnated on the searchand had trouble getting interviews for a long period, mostly was using job boards, and occasionally opportunities from my school network. I wasnt very close during school with my professors or the other students, I now believe not networking back then was a massive mistake, which I didnt realize at that time. 

Since then Ive had periods where I stopped looking because it felt hopeless, but ultimately I dont want my entire degree and experiences to go to waste. It has been a long time since graduating now, but Im wondering if anyone believes I can still get a full time position related to the degree or even entry level HR?

Since that break, I landed an analyst role in September and realize I really enjoy this role. I work in nonprofit social services and not only is the day to day work enjoyable but I feel that the people I am working with are doing something I highly value, supporting the community.

 I am wanting to complete a Masters level degree but am unsure what degree would benefit me most. I am afraid to box myself into public health as an industry. The degrees I have considered are:
- finishing my IO Psych MA
- pursuing an MBA
- Data Science MS

I think each degree has pros and cons. I dont want to limit myself in any way. Given the job market post-covid, I feel its important to have a skill set applicable to many fields. I am skeptical of how much IO Psych will help me in the job market. When I look at middle management roles in Quality Assurance and Continuous Quality Improvement I never see IO Psych as an applicable masters. I typically see Public Health, Socia Work and Business Administration.

2023-10-01,1696194950,Breaking into Consulting with an I/O Degree: Seeking Insights &amp; Guidance,"I recently graduated with a master's in I/O Psychology back in May and have developed a keen interest in consulting, stemming from numerous case studies and projects during my studies. I've since taken an Organizational Development role (I do not see myself here long-term), but I'm also actively working two part-time consulting gigs. I'm seeking advice on breaking into the realm of consulting, especially at top-tier firms. Any insights would be greatly appreciated.

**My Background**:

* Graduated with a 3.8 GPA in May.
* Gained real-world consulting experience from 7-10 case studies/projects during my master's.
* Worked a full-time Co-op at a top Aerospace and Defense company in my final year but was let go back in May due to a hiring freeze.
* Currently in an Organizational Development role at a major manufacturing organization.
* I'm also a consultant for a university and work on psychometric data analytics for a startup. As I mentioned above, these are both part-time contracted gigs. The university just extended my contract. 
* Recently networked with an individual from McKinsey &amp; Company, leading to a recommendation letter for me. I met this individual in person at a wedding event, and we seemed to have good chemistry over the 45-minute conversation. 

**Career Aspiration**: To accumulate enough experience and credentials to eventually establish my own consulting firm. Ideally, I'd love to gain some insights and experiences from big-name firms for credibility.

**Seeking Guidance On**:

* How did you get your break into consulting?
* Strategies to leverage an I/O degree when most firms prioritize MBAs.
* Networking and application tactics that have worked for you.

**Applications Status**:

* McKinsey  Applied with recommendation
* Bain &amp; BCG  Applied online
* Kornferry, Deloitte, Humu, Gallup  Applied and rejected

I started transitioning from my first career choice about three years ago. When I got into my current organization, I helped develop a department for volunteers that need specific trainings.

This department was eventually fully established and I was placed as the manager. 

Cut to now and there has been an HR Generalist position opened. When I spoke with my COO and the HR manager, they've decided to hire me internally. I'm currently pursuing a Master's in IOP, but I figured I would pick the professional brains here! 

Our current department is working on ensuring compliance in all departments, improving talent acquisition, and reducing turnover.

2023-09-14,1694714014,Master's in IO Psyc ( ~1.5 yrs post-grad) Looking for Job Search Advice!,"Hello all,

**TLDR:** IO Psych grad 1.5 years out had a 1 year job in tech learning and development, got layed off, now really struggling to get interviews and needs advice.

I graduated with my MS in IO in May of 2022 and after less than a year at my first job post grad, I'm on the search again! I am really struggling to get interviews and am starting to feel rather hopeless about this situation. I've applied to 52 jobs and have had one interview.

 In August of 2022 I got a job as a Training Consultant for a software as a service advisory company. This job was fantastic (for some of the time) fully remote work, flexible schedule, positive and psychologically safe culture, and the work was fun. About halfway through it became less great for a variety of reasons, all of which I believe were due to the fact that customers just were not buying the way they used to. I was impacted by the company's second round of layoffs in a short timespan. In mid July, I was let go with absolutely no notice. To make matters worse, I had just moved back to my home state of California where the COL is higher. The plan was for me to support my family while my husband finished school, it's incredibly hard to do that without a job! 

I have an undergraduate degree in Psychology with a minor in Project Management. I held a minor teaching assistant position for one semester, in which I taught students portions of Abnormal Psychology lesson plans. While studying for my MS in IO, I completed two internship experiences. The first was a general Consulting Psychology position, most of my experience with that centers on training development and delivery and assisting clients with selection and developmental activities through individual psychological assessment processes. In my other position, working as a Data Analyst at my university's Career Center, I evaluated the university's programs and procedures for effectiveness (I would liken this to Org Change or Org Development work). Additionally, I worked as a graduate research assistant conducting research in the area of work-life balance. This is the extent of my relevant work experience. While working for the SAAS company, they paid for my certification in *Prosci Change Management.* I'm a big fan of this and would love to use it wherever I go.

I don't know what I'm doing wrong with job search strategy. Here's what my current strategy consists of:

*  LinkedIn and Career Coach advice has told me laser in on specific jobs and tailor my resume and cover letter to those jobs, with small edits to fit the company culture and expectations of the job. I've done this - looking at positions like Learning and Development/Training Consultant **OR** Change Management Consultant. I am applying for internal and external roles.
* I am using Resume and Cover Letter templates given to me by a career coach I was connected with. Her services and associated resources are part of the severance package I received.
* After sending in an application, I'm using LinkedIn to reach out to folks close to the role in the organization. It consists of a friendly hello, communicating my interest in the position, asking if they have a contact I can ask questions, and of course thanking them. *This is the only reason I received the one interview I've had.*
* I am following up on applications if I have not heard anything back.

Where my frustration really lies is in the fact that I am not getting offered interviews. I feel strongly that if I can speak to a human, I can demonstrate my competency and passion. 

# I am looking for advice here: Have you been in a similar situation, what were your strategies? What strategies am I missing? How do I get interviews? I'd also be interested in advice on how to make connections.

* Each Quarter 1, my company surveys all employees with 81 questions, receiving a 75% response rate (\~5200 employees).
* We introduced pulse surveys, selecting 15 items from the original survey: 5 for executive-requested changes, 5 for employee sentiment, and 5 for values assessment.
* A priori power analysis was conducted to determine appropriate sample sizes based on desired effect sizes.
* An anti-clustering algorithm is employed to select representative samples, considering factors like career level, geographic region, tenure group, division, race/ethnicity, and gender.
* Once an individual is selected, they cannot be reselected for 1-2 months.
* Pulse surveys are conducted monthly, covering approximately 1/12 of the organization (effect size \~0.5 - There are more layers to this that I won't go into). 
* The goal is to analyze and compare the data obtained from the quarterly Q1 survey as well as track monthly trends.

&amp;#x200B;

Problem:

Non-response bias needs to be accounted for, as it affects the demographic composition in each round.

&amp;#x200B;

Technically, we have people who are taking the pulse who took the q1 survey and we can do a longitudinal analysis, but it won't give a full picture since there are people who didn't take the q1 survey and there are people who are newly hired and what not.

I have read that I can use a mixed-model analysis, but my concern is that by using the admin date of the survey as the fixed effect is in a way double-counting it and I am also concerned as the results will be more dynamic and less static. Executive will most likely question why results varied from last month if I did this approach.  I did read that I can do a design effect analysis, but I am cautious about how accurate that can be.

2023-09-06,1694025599,What would be included in the I/O Psych Iceberg? [Discussion],"For those of you who aren't aware, an Iceberg (or ""The Iceberg Theory"") in this case refers to a way of explaining a particular subject that covers a wide range of topics, from the commonly known to the esoteric. Using an iceberg as an analogy, the more commonly-known aspects of that subject would be at the tip above the water line. As the discussion ""submerges"" below, going deeper, the more obscure and maybe even abstruse the topic can get. [I've come across a few of these on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=psychology+iceberg) and thought it would be interesting to see what an IO version of this would look like.

Granted, the field is not very well known as it is, so we probably could generate maybe 3 or 4 tiers of solid content. And lord knows I am but one practitioner, standing on the shoulders of giants and a drop in the sizeable IO community with greater scope of knowledge. I'd love to see what folks here could come up with and how deep we can go.

Just to start us off, this is kind of how I might structure it:

**Tier 1:**
[The 101 stuff] Job Analysis, Performance Appraisal, Training, ""The Science of Work"", SIOP, Organizations, etc...

**Tier 2:**
[Various theories and well-known researchers] Goal-Setting Theory, ASA, Schmidt, Hunter, Barrack, Mount, etc...

**Tier 3:**
[Lesser known or emerging theories and research topics]

**Tier 4:**

2023-09-05,1693958377,Collaboration VS Performance Management,"Hello everyone! Longtime commenter and first-time poster here. I've recently graduated and finally have some free time to delve into my personal interests. Currently, I'm reading the works of Edward Deming, who stressed the significance of collaboration over competition for achieving success in the market.

Deming strongly criticized Performance Management systems for their inherent challenges in measuring all relevant aspects without fostering unhealthy competition or devaluing certain skills. For instance, it's well-known in our field (referred to as Price's Law) that around 30% of employees typically handle 50% of the workload. However, this may not hold true when evaluating intangibles like ""Servant Leadership"" or addressing issues to support top performers within their roles. Deming advocates for a strategy that emphasizes collaboration, valuing each team member's unique contributions. Collaboration, according to Deming, is the only ***long term sustainable practice*** for business success.

In Deming's view, rewarding successful teams equally makes sense, as they all bring their distinctive strengths to the table; ***otherwise, why hire them in the first place****?*

However, I recently completed a compensation studies certificate that highlighted the importance of pay-for-performance to retain and attract top talent. While some case studies showcased the pitfalls of its incorrect implementation, resulting in the neglect of valuable skills like mentorship and project failure, overall, this approach proved highly effective when executed correctly, leading to significant project success, ***especially in the short term***.

I'm currently reflecting on the interplay between short-term and long-term strategies within these two distinct systems. I'm considering writing an article on this topic once I've clarified my thoughts, and I'd greatly appreciate your insights and any literary references to expedite my process!",IOPsychology,9,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/16b4pqx/collaboration_vs_performance_management/

I also have a focus on marginalized community discovering their power and voice in both writing and public speaking. 

It's what I love. I know I'm great at it. I also know I have a BUNCH of stuff I'd like to learn still so I can be even better.

I've been wanting to transition to working with making organisations more people friendly with all its diversity. I see that there are many DEI masters programs (I have a Bachelor's degree in Business), but DEI is a bit of a shaky industry and I don't think I want it to be my core consultation business. Hence, I was looking at IOP masters so that I can work with corporates, or even start my own consulting company and incorporate DEI into my policies and strategy making. I'm passionate about empowering employees at workplace by bringing about a change in leadership and org behaviour, whether via training, recruiting or program mgt.

- Reducing academic performance to a single number (GPA) assumes that academic performance is unidimensional. Academic performance is probably multidimensional, although im not sure what those dimensions might be
- GPA is mostly used as a selection tool to decide who gets into college (or grad school). It is almost useless as a development tool and a more comprehensive measure of academic performance could give students better insight into how they could improve.
- Obvious reliability concerns. Grading standards vary between schools, courses, and instructors.
- Since any score 90% or above gets an A (4.0), GPA is almost useless for distinguishing high performing students. At the other end, all low scorers (below 60%) receive 0 grade points, so GPA is useless for distinguishing low scorers as well.

I've been quite confused about which career to select as per my personality. Its that I have not come to any conclusion yet that what my interests are. It keep on changing due to my moods as I have been battling with bipolar for more tha 10 years and recently got proper diagnoised. So next stage of my life to opt for good career to make some money plus a fullfilled way of working.   


I have read many materials to know what would suit me but when concluding i would not have the self-belief/confidence in it. I read a book based on DISC(surrounded by idiots) and it helped me where I would fall in personality dynamics but I am not able to trust it as my personality is still developing. I even tried to read some material on TA to help me with my ego state, but to some extent that has left me confused.

I just dont want to be wrong this time selecting a career as I have tried many jobs but could not fit in.   


Which career based psychometric would suit me better? If there is any other way please let me know too.

I study part-time and have been take classes in primarily behavioral neuroscience and statistics. I really enjoy what I've studied and wrote a paper on ""Cortisol, Stress, and the Health Impacts They Can Have"" for class. 

Why am I mentioning this in IO Psych? After I get through the biology of it, I explore how it's impacts people in their everyday lives and delve some into ADA law and then finish with how stress mindsets can impact the stress response and cortisol levels. (Context:  I came up with the idea myself and drafted an outline for the professor after some discussion.) 

Where this all comes together for me is that I suspect that going forward, reasonable accommodations in the workplace and classroom will take on a more preventative aspect than they have had to so far, especially when we consider the differences faced by people experiencing stress-related disease and/or are neurodivergent. 

S0...some science, some data analysis, some law and just trying to stick it all together to come up with better sustainable solutions for people...hopefully before they have to see a doctor.

I don't say this to introduce you to a sob story, this is just a small possibility and I'd like to have fall-back/future career if necessary.

A person of my age would like to be reasonably assured that there's a future in what they're doing as I don't have as much future left as I once did.

2023-12-04,1701733723,Struggling to find job in IO after graduating,"Hello!   
(This is my first reddit post so I apologize if this type of posting is not allowed! I'm really just at the end of my rope with this and was not sure where else to turn for assistance).   
I was wondering if anyone could lead me in the best direction and/or provide any tips/tricks to navigating the job search field (a pick-me-up pep talk would be awesome as well as these last few months have been extremely disheartening).

I graduated in 2017 with a B.S. in Psychology, and worked for 5 years in a customer service role for a software company. I moved to the Boston area from Ohio to complete my degree in 2022, graduated with my M.S. in I/O May 2023. I was an intern full time for the summer in the L&amp;D department at an insurance company, but have not had any other I/O work experience as while completing my degree I worked a few positions on campus in order to have my school fees waived. 

Since graduating, I have been struggling to find a job anywhere in the field that does not require prior work experience along with a master's degree. It is getting to the point that I am nervous that I will have to move back to Ohio and live with my parents (which is not what I would like to do but I also do not want to burn away much more of my savings). 

My question: Does anyone have any suggestions on what I might be doing wrong, leads on better ideas for where to go for looking for a job, or better tips on my plan of action?

I've used the following websites to search for jobs: Monster, Glassdoor, LinkedIn, Indeed, Handshake, SIOP's website. I also did direct searches for the job positions on any local universities, hospitals, and businesses in the Boston area to see if they were hiring, but did not have any luck. 

I've kept a close network with my cohort and other connections in the field since graduating, but most of my cohort also seems to be struggling on finding something. I've also worked with hiring agencies but have not had any luck with them returning my calls/emails. 

My original salary range on was 60,000 - 70,000, but at this point I've lowered it to 52,000 - 62,000 as an attempt to hopefully get more offers (which I believe is a more than reasonable range with my Masters + living in Massachusetts, as my roommate works as an editor making 55,000 with a Bachelors, and I've checked O\*Net for positions that I'm eligible for and know I'm lowballing a bit on the amounts).

I have looked at all modalities for work, as while I would love to work remotely (as it would save me so much more $$$), I am desperate for anything. 

I have looked for positions mainly in Learning and Development, HR, and Talent Acquisition/Recruiting. 

In the last few months, I ended up working a part-time job waitressing to help make ends meet, but with winter coming on many places are starting to close early/have cut hours, and I am nervous that I will not be able to make enough for rent these next few months. I would prefer not to work in customer service on the phone again as I got my master's to escape working a job like that.

Any suggestions, tips, or tricks that I might be missing? Or any companies that you recommend would hire someone with a Masters in I/O but little work experience? (Also, any pick me up advice would be greatly appreciated, as these last few months have hit my mental and physical health hard). TYIA!

Update: After 7 months of searching for an I/O job, I finally got one! It ended up being at a local job coaching/recruiting firm, pays $60k, and it's less than a 10 min drive from my apartment. Honestly such a relief on all ends to have found something so close that I could walk there if I needed to! 
I ended up searching a local job forum for the city, and after reaching out to the business a few times and contacting the head of the program I was able to land an interview. I was later told by an employee that while me having my masters was impressive the manager in the meeting was most impressed and felt I stood out by the way I was able to communicate how my IO skills can be used to within this role + (oddly enough) my previous customer service experience and current food service roles.
 Thank you again for everyone who reached out with their kind words and advice!! It gave me such an extra needed boost, and I doubt I would've been as persistent on getting this position if not for that!

I graduated last May with my master's in I-O Psychology. I spend my 20s to mid 30s working in fundraising for nonprofits, then switched over to admin and executive support for a variety of companies like law firms and management consulting. 

I am currently in Resource Management at an accounting firm. I like it a lot, but the team is a bit disorganized and there is no clear leadership. The resource management department itself is just two years old. I thought I might enjoy the autonomy of being part of a younger, emerging division of the company but it is just sporadic and ineffective. We keep growing and hiring more accountants, and then hire more resource management staff, but without any transparency or consistency. 

I joined in April 2023 and did not receive any training for the role and it was a new position and industry for me (sigh). After a really serious talk with my boss about how I don't understand the business and how she doesn't have time for me, I am now teaching myself the role and doing what I can to upskill. 

Overall, I'm not doing a lot to really help my colleagues or create lasting impact like I thought. I mainly schedule projects, review billable time on timesheets, oversee utilization hours, and interact with our interns and new hires on a super intermittent basis. It is part of the human resources department and I love and gaining insight into that, but the passion on my team isn't there. 

The firm has an operations / project management office that works with organizational development, mergers/acquisitions, training, software licensing, and change management. It is really the ""nerve center"" of the company. They are very established with their policies, procedures, and best practices. The director and I spoke about an opening and she wants me to apply. Just wondering, does anyone has experience working in this type of role? It is a senior specialist, operations and project management. 

I do have some PM experience at the coordinator level before I went back to school, so it may be a better fit for me as well. I don't know exactly what it all entails but it sounds like an exciting opportunity. But, it won't be part of HR. Or, do I stick it out and try to keep ""proving"" myself to a boss who has checked out and just hope we gel better once I have been here longer?

2024-02-17,1708187391,How to proactively measure strain/burnout/employee well-being?,"Hello!

I'm doing a university project for an organization. They want to know how to proactively measure strain and burnout in a population of 100 employees from the same department. They also wanted to know which job demands and which job resources are abundant in this employee population so I have adopted a JD-R -model perspective. For reasons not dependent on me, I'm not able to use a survey to map the possible demands and resources and have to interview some of the employees to find out which demands and which resources they feel are present in their work. I know, this is not the best way to approach this question since I can not interview every single employee, the employees being interviewed may emphasize different job characteristics in different ways etc. However, since the JD-R -model/theory posits that different jobs have different demands and different resources, and the demands and resources of this population have not been studied before, maybe I can find some ""new"" job/occupation-specific resources and demands from the interviews. 

My line of thought is that by recognizing the key demands &amp; resources and monitoring them, strain, burnout and work engagement could be influenced. I know JD-R has it's own pitfalls but this is the best I can think of. 

However, I'm having a hard time to find any literature or studies on other ways to proactively measure strain/burnout before it turns in to sickness absences etc. The organization doesn't actively measure anything well-being related (at least in my opinion) so they really don't have a baseline for employee well-being. They use a regular eNPS-survey but I feel that it doesn't really tap anything relevant to employee well-being. Maybe it could be used as a predictive tool (?) but I think that if you feel burnt out in your job the lower eNPS-score is maybe a consequence of that and not something that accurately predicts lower well-being. Do you have any thoughts on this?

I also feel that measuring burnout/strain has some serious ethical considerations. Burnout measurements tend to be pretty long (how many employees would take the time to answer those?), hard to interpret/get interpret wrong (which I feel is dangerous) and altogether I feel a bit uneasy with the whole topic  burnout assessment tools include some pretty sensitive information that I feel could be used in wrong ways even though the survey process would be completely anonymized. 

Maybe a work engagement scale would be better? I feel that employees would feel ""safer"" to answer questions regarding vigour, motivation etc. 

My task is not to test which scales or methods of measuring work the best since I am only doing recommendations based on scientific literature. 

Do you have any ideas what kinds of measurements or scales could be used in a proactive manner that could actually be used in a group of 100 people?

2024-02-15,1708006851,Deciding between social or cognitive psych supervisor for undergrad thesis,"I am an undergraduate student planning on pursuing a master's/PhD in IO psych. Next year, I will be undertaking an independent research project under the supervision of a faculty member, resulting in an undergrad thesis. In an ideal scenario, I would choose a supervisor whose research interests are most compatible with my goals, but unfortunately, there are no IO psychs in my uni's psych department, and of the remaining viable supervisors, their fit isn't exactly clear to me.

Social psych:

* Supervisor ""Social A"" studies how emotion and motivation influence attentive, cognitive, and social processes. They examine a range of emotive states and traits, including anger, jealousy, desire, sadness, and humility. They also examine conflicts between motivations from the perspective of cognitive dissonance theory. In general, they take a neuropsychological approach.
* ""Social B"" studies the ways that emotions both arise from and shape social processes. They focus on positive emotions such as pride and gratitude and outcomes ranging from prosocial behaviour to loneliness, and psychological wellbeing to relationship dynamics.

Cognitive psych:

* ""Cognitive A"" studies the psychological and neural bases of learning and motivation, particularly relating goal-directed action, reward learning, predictive learning and decision-making. In general, they also take a neuropsychological approach.
* ""Cognitive B"" studies the cognitive processes underlying judgment, choice and decision-making and the application of this knowledge to environmental, financial, medical, and forensic contexts.

From these descriptions, it seems to me that ""Cognitive B"" is the best fit. Judgement and decision-making seems to be more relevant to IO psych than the other options. But more importantly, the use of psychological research to generate practical insights in other fields looks exactly like the work of an applied or IO psychologist. Right?

However, I am concerned that there are differences more inherent to social and cognitive psych research that may be differentially useful to my future grad studies. For instance, differences in research methods, data collection methods, exposure to psychometrics etc.

In summary, I would like some insight into how social or cognitive psych may broadly relate to work as an IO psychologist (yours or otherwise), and if you were in my position, which of the mentioned supervisors would you pick and why?",IOPsychology,7,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/1arghm3/deciding_between_social_or_cognitive_psych/

That is not me, and I wonder how much people actually feel that way, and how many are just putting on a face. I don't hate the work, and I realize some times work is just work, but lately I've been wondering if anyone else feels the same way about their job in I/O, or maybe it's just something that all people experience throughout their lives.

I day dream about the idea of just working at a retail store as a cashier, it honestly sounds less stressful and more social, but obviously don't pay nearly as much. With that said, I was wondering if anyone out there has felt the same way and ""abandoned"" their I/O training/background and switched careers to something else, what that switch was, and whether or not it made a difference, or in 6 months you are in the same spot all over again but with a low paying job.

I read about it, there are multiple things you can do. Ask better questions, keep the survey short, segment your audience so if you want 4 surveys a year only ask half your employees so they only have to answer 2.

Talk about the results of the survey and the actions youre gonna take because of it.

A kind of out there idea for a business tool im thinking about: Make it open source, so we can guarantee to employees its completely anonymous.

There are several ways you can take this idea. Obviously a lot of survey builders are out there, but this product would help with how to structure a survey, how long to make it, rephrase questions maybe, only let you do certain type of questions (the tools confuse you with too many options), send mails to participants when actions have been taken, remind you to take such actions etc.

Put a lot into the UI on the participants side to raise response rate.

Im not looking to completely replace a survey expert. It would probably turn into more of a mix between software and consulting. I know nothing about how to run surveys atm tho.

My supervisor called me in to say that she was very impressed with the work I've done so far. I'm considered an intern in the federal government due to my position, but I've had my MS for two years and am working on my PhD, so I've volunteered for work similar to what those 2-3 pay grades above me are doing - both in I/O and in HR.

Anyway, my supervisor asked me about my career goals. I enjoy I/O and am working on a PhD in I/O, but I also really enjoy the HR work I am doing right now, so much so that I've been seriously considering switching for a while. Also, my agency has ample opportunities for international work. So, I told her that I really liked being in the hybrid space of HR and I/O, and I was open to new experiences. She responded by saying she'd keep an eye out for a higher-level position - one that would almost definitely take me further out of I/O.

My mentor is retiring late this year. She's the only I/O psychologist in our department. We've been trying to find her replacement since before I started, but the requirements they're asking for are just too prohibitive to non-federal I/Os. I am too junior to be built into the role currently, so most likely, I would be supporting our replacement I/O in the meantime, if we ever get one...

Anyway, the main thing I am afraid of is getting so far from I/O that, should I decide to return to such a role, I would be too far removed from the field. I feel like that should not be the case given I'm still in HR, but I can't say for sure.

2024-01-26,1706309957,MBA and Master of I/O? Worth it?,"Hello all! I am currently pursuing my MBA (26F) with a concentration in Industrial Organizational Psychology. I have my B.S. in Psychology and in my undergrad I have published research so I am interested in research-heavy majors and using my skills for that. 

The reason I am doing an MBA is because I was not 100% sure of what I wanted to do and I am working in a professional field and have been since 20 so I thought it would make sense for me just to boost my resume to get better pay. Well, I want to get into I/O because all the jobs in that field fascinate me like no other. I also always had an interest in I/O and almost went for it instead of the MBA but thought I could be more versatile with the MBA. 

Now here is my dilemma: 

My current MBA with a concentration in I/O will leave me HALF way finished with the Master of I/O degree. I unfortunately cannot pursue both Masters at the same time. However, it will take me 2-3 semesters to finish the 2nd Masters if I wish after the MBA. My concern is, I really did not want to come out with more debt than I planned, this will result in me taking another year of financial aid. I am working full-time and work somewhere I can get loan forgiveness and plan on staying maybe even 10 years so I could possibly get the loan forgiveness but I don't know for sure. So really if I pursue the 2nd Masters I will be a bit financially strained for longer and adding another year of schooling on me (total of 3  years come out at 29 years old with these). I do love school however but at some point, I need to just be free. Should I drop out of my MBA and pursue I/O to save money and waste what I just did, or should I pursue both and get I/O after MBA?

2 - Take away number two: context is king (or queen). Need to put whatever your projects goals are in terms of the CEOs goals and the broader context of their daily concerns or industry trends.

3 - Take away three - dont have a dozen action items. Dont have twenty slides for a first meeting.

Similar to take away two, make sure youre presentation is simple yet memorable. 

I think of this one as having a theme. People remember themes. Your action items should fit into the theme, but its okay to have a campaign theme for your talent strategy, your IO Project, or your research assignments. Oh. And repeat the theme throughout your discussion.

2024-04-16,1713304676,Recent IO Masters grad& ,"Recently went through the whole masters grad/IO  job search and honestly it was VERY frustrating. 
Ive been working since I was in highschool, so prefacing this with saying I am no stranger to work, working overtime, lower wages, etc. I had high hopes for getting job after masters in IO. 

Background of about 4 years in Org Development, with project experience in Job Analysis, Change Management, Performance Management. I also didnt go to a top IO school, but I was very impressed with my school (primarily known for STEM) and it was NOT easy. 

- I was honestly baffled at the experience to pay ratio, with most IO job postings requiring 5+ years of experience for anything above ~$45k/year. 

- Not only did it take me about 4 months post-masters to find something (and ended up changing sectors), but the amount of work I put into interviews was draining.
- I was spending hours of my personal time filling out long af applications on THEIR websites, (after they request that) researching companies, researching job duties, etc. I dont understand how someone would get anywhere past first interview without doing that? 

- I had about 10 1st stage interviews, 5 2nd stage, and interviewed at 3rd stage or higher for three different positions. I was told they wanted more experience and didnt get the job on 2 of them, and I wasnt able to put together a mock training presentation to present to directors and managers in time for the 3rd due to work deadlines and short notice (wanted it within 2 days). 

Another thing I was told was IO networking. However, most IO networking events/zooms were always during work hours???? Are other job seekers able to do this while still working?  

Where I draw the line, and honestly have no idea how everyone else is doing it, was the amount of companys who were wanting applicants to create mock presentations, training programs, etc. during the hiring process.  I had to do this 4 different times. And I was applying  and interviewing for OD, T&amp;D, Consulting, different IO positions. 

BIG TAKEAWAYS- I wish I wouldve networked more in my masters program AND I wish my work schedule/life would have allowed for an internship. I think those would have helped to find a higher paying job sooner. 

I just dont understand how were supposed to have the time to jump through all of the extra hoops recruiters/companies are expecting people to go through. 

ETA: I was looking for and interviewing for similar jobs to my current role like business development specialist, consultant roles, development specialist and manager roles, pretty much lateral moves from where I was while applying.

2024-04-16,1713238062,Should I stay at my job or look for a job with more growth opportunity?,"
3 years ago, near the end of my undergrad, I (25F - Australia) started working at a small HR/recruiting firm as a HR Coordinator. Recently I was promoted to Organisational Development Advisor. I am finishing my APGD end of this year (4th yr honours equivalent). From then, I will be eligible to apply for masters and get my provisional psych registration. *(Australian study pathway context: After my masters/exam I will become a generally registered psych. After gaining a few years experience, I then plan to do my 1 year bridging course to get endorsed as an I/O psych).*

I love my job. I am hybrid and only work 4-day weeks which has made my studies way more manageable. My team are lovely, my boss is supportive, I have incredible work-life balance and a lot of say over how I do my work. Pre-tax &amp; student loans Im on $84k AUD pro rata (4 days) which is fairly standard, but given Im in a high CoL area, I could do better.

At work I quickly found myself becoming the go-to data analysis, research and systems improvement person. Whilst I do enjoy it, there isnt really anyone more experienced in this area to guide me. Some of the things I deal with are above my expertise and the amount of time I spend on figuring it out my own, unsure if what Im doing is right feels frustrating and ineffective. I have also been wondering about exploring other industries (currently in construction) and with all the job ads and recruiter messages Ive seen, I have been getting massive FOMO.

With my recent promotion, the goal was to give me more client-facing and project lead experience - this way I can target a development area that my boss/company is actually equipped to support me with. Nevertheless, I find progress on this front is somewhat slow, and I dont want to stop the analysing side entirely as it is a core interest of mine. Still, Ive recently been doing a little more work on internal projects with the org psych who consults with us (different team). Shes lovely and its been nice to have someone to bounce off. She also said shes happy to do the accredited certification to become my masters supervisor later on if my program allows for it.

Overall, whilst my role is I/O adjacent, things are moving slowly. I feel like my career/skills progression could definitely be expedited by moving to an actual I/O firm. However, I worry that moving jobs may mean losing out on the safety, comfort and flexibility of my current job that has been essential for managing my studies. Without this, it may be way harder and take much longer to complete my masters. However, masters programs are also highly competitive and theres no telling if I will get in immediately.

Any advice? Should I remain comfortable at this company for the next 2-3 years until I become an officially qualified psych? Or is it worth searching for a job more in line with my development needs and interests before then?",IOPsychology,6,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/1c5650l/should_i_stay_at_my_job_or_look_for_a_job_with/

2024-04-11,1712860991,Laid Off From Tech - Looking to Pivot to I/O Degree and Job.,"Hey everyone,

I'm new here! I'm a 32 year old woman, based in San Francisco, who recently lost my job during the tech layoffs. I am considering returning to school to pursue a Masters degree in I/O Psychology (maybe at San Francisco State or out of state). This field was something that I was very interested in when I was finishing my BA degree in general psychology. I had good grades, was in Psi Chi Honors, and enjoyed my Human Factors and I/O-related classes. However, I was a broke and very disillusioned student back then with no real work experience so I pursued different opportunities.

After 5 years of project coordinator work, I am debt free now, built a great business network, and have a lot of savings for rent and tuition which is why I'm revisiting this old dream of mine. I'm interested in possibly being a researcher or consultant in the tech industry, preferably in gaming companies. I feel like this work would be more personally rewarding than what I used to do.

**Questions (open to DMs!):**

1. What was your I/O career path? (And salary if you are willing to share.)
2. What are some consulting firms that would be great for I/O psychologists to aim for?
3. What are some challenges that you face in your profession given tech industry recession fears and layoffs?
4. I understand that academic careers involve being geographically flexible. I plan to stay in the Bay Area/California for long-term, will this set me back quite a bit?
5. Not a Q but I'm also going to visit SIOP 2024 to attend workshops and talk to people to get a better idea of things and to enjoy Chicago.

Based on my research, it seems like the thing I probably should have studied in college - I just didn't know it was available to me at the time. I'm not exactly passionate about my ""first"" career path, mostly because:

1. I'm just looking at numbers all day, not really feeling like I'm helping anyone other my clients and their investors... or anyone, really. I think I'd prefer a job where I'm spending my work hours actually positively impacting people in some way. I've considered therapy/counseling, but unfortunately, it seems that the pay is not enough to sustain my long-term goal of having a family in a VHCOL area, so I probably need to stick with some sort of corporate job (for now).
2. The work hours are very variable and can be quite intensive. One week I could be working 40 hours, then out of nowhere I could be working anywhere from 45-60 hours or more for months on end if clients come in with a fire drill project. This makes it very stressful as someone who doesn't like unpredictability, and I know that my field has a tendency to have cyclical busy periods of 50-55 hours/week even if I moved to a job that wasn't client-facing.

My question is whether these two big dislikes about my current role are still applicable to most jobs in IO. Like my current field, I know that it probably depends on what you do with your degree (consulting vs. HR vs. people analytics, etc.), so interested to hear the perspective of people who are out actually doing the work day-to-day. Moving into IO would require me to probably take 3-6 months off of work to get the psychology course pre-reqs for master's programs done (looks like it's anywhere from 5-15 classes depending on the schools I'm looking at), then another two years assuming I actually get into programs. That's a huge commitment in terms of both time and money, so I'm trying to figure out whether this would even be a worthwhile jump overall.

Now, as my issues get more complicated I'm looking into online programs for maybe just the first year so I can get better and then try for an on campus program.

As I read posts in here about the job market I get a little worried. However I also believe as more people discover that they are ADHD, and the more the employment landscape changes, there's just not enough research out there on workplace neurodiversity to support the evolution. 

Here's the thing:

ªI took the GRE last year even though I didn't have to and got a 309. Math sucked but I got a 5 for writing.

ªI have some certifications in applied neuroscience and I'm a certified ADHD coach.
ªI really don't want the program to be through a business school because I really want to learn more of the psychological dynamics.

I feel like online programs may be the way to go at first because of my health issues, but I also know that sometimes they are looked down on. I saw some people mentioning CSU and I've seen a lot of discussion on online for master's. I guess I'd like to get the thoughts of people who know the industry and know the programs.

2024-03-28,1711655374,Uncertain about the scope of I/O in India,"I completed my bachelor's in Psychology, Criminology and English Literature last August and am currently pursuing a PG Diploma in Counselling. To be honest, I only decided to go for the diploma because I wanted some time to actually think about which field I was most attracted to without feeling like I wasted my time.

I always knew I wanted to go for something in Psychology and while I was interested in (and enjoyed) learning about all the clinical disorders, I realized it wasn't something I wanted to pursue a career in.  We had a semester specifically catered to I/O psychology and it really got me thinking about the field in detail. I have researched about it and know that pursuing a Masters in I/O can lead to a lot of different job positions in theory but a lot of posts here kind of make me think that it isn't really true in reality.  It also has to do with the fact that many people here in India are not aware of the field or do not believe in its value and prefer an MBA instead.

I really like various aspects of I/O that I have learned about and want to know (study) more about them so that I can make a solid decision on my career after pursuing a Masters but I am hesitant to do so. I thought about trying abroad as well but the cost is not really worth the uncertainty. I also do not think I have the specs enough for it. I have looked up Fergusson and Christ and the programs intrigue me.

If anyone has taken up I/O or has pursued it, please share your experience here. It would really be very helpful for me.",IOPsychology,10,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/1bq4t1j/uncertain_about_the_scope_of_io_in_india/

I recently finished a MSIOP degree last year. I understand the job market is cheeks right now. But its really starting to get to me. I have spent most of my adult life trying to get out of the family poverty cycle without going into a field that I was either not interested in or would be bad at. Fast forward to now and it feels like this degree was a waste of time. Overqualified for basic roles, but not enough experience for other roles. I dont have a large network to rely on because I literally could not invest the time with other family obligations on top of ASD. I know that typically those of us in poverty have more challenges moving up the social/income ladder, but when is something going to give. I refuse to let my ASD define me, but it creates unique barriers neurotypicals do not face. 

Im tired of ended up living in my car every few years. Im tired of having to live on food stamps. Applying non-stop for jobs, never to hear back anything. 

I need some hope. Ive drained all I had on surviving graduate school. When does this get better?

2024-03-20,1710916227,Transition from Clinical to I/O; is a PhD worth it?,"Hi all,   
I am in a bit of a predicament about where I should take my career. This past year has been incredibly difficult due to being sent back to my home country due to not finding a Visa sponsored job in the UK. For context; I completed my Bachelors in Psychology and Masters in Clinical Psychology (1 year), all from the UK. I stayed a further two years there working as a support worker in prominent mental health charities. I have always been passionate about psychology, and seemed like Clinical was the way for me. However, of late, I have been incredibly disappointed by the scope there is in Clinical Psychology, especially in the UK for International Students. I also do not think a future in the UK is going to be very good due to the current economic and political conditions.   

After some research, and speaking to ex-professors, they have suggested a PhD in I/O psychology as a way to transition into the field. I am in no way suggesting it is easier to pursue, I am well aware of the challenges a PhD will come with (e.g. financial stress, workload etc). However, I have always liked research and enjoyed my undergraduate and master's dissertation process. There are a few PhD courses in the Netherlands where they will give a salary to pursue this, which seems like a good deal to me.   

On the other hand, I have also wondered if I need to get some work experience in HR or I/O psychology before pursuing a PhD. However, with today's job market, I do not see a possibility of me getting anywhere with this without a long waiting period, which frankly I a cannot afford.   


Therefore, does anyone have any suggestions on whether this will be a good idea to pursue a PhD in the I/O field? Or would you suggest I find work experience in HR or I/O and work my way up? If i choose the second option, will it be possible for someone from a clinical background to make this career change - I am currently enrolled in some Coursera courses in HR and Organisational psychology to have that extra credential- but will this be enough.

TLDR; would getting a minor in business with a major in psychology help me in the future, grad school and career-wise? Is this a strange combination?


To preface, I started my bachelors with the intention of going into clinical psychology. However, I realized after a while that clinical/counseling wasnt sparking my interests. I have spent the past 10 years working for different employers and really enjoy being a manger because I can oversee everything, make adjustments, and my passion is creating a safe environment for employees to thrive, seeing as people spend a majority of their time at work. I discovered IO psychology and decided to switch my focus from clinical. 

That being said, I have just enough time to get a minor. I originally wanted to minor in stats, but I cant minor in stats without extending my graduation date by a semester or two (prerequisites). As a 30y.o who spent 7 years slowly working on their AA, the last thing I want to do is spend more time in school than needed. Im also going to be a TA for stats and research methods and so hopefully that will help for grad school applications. 

My advisor brought up getting a minor in business. I know business is basically a complete different field from IO psych, but it intrigues me because when I started my AA, I intended on going into business administration.

Anyway, my question is essentially this: would getting a minor in business with a major in psychology help me at all? Would it be weird? I have not heard of many psych majors with a minor in business, and before I start taking classes for the minor, I want to know if this would lead me to a dead end.

I'm looking for possibly a few clients that I can do fairly boutique/specialized work for. I don't want to start a business or manage a team or anything like that. Is this possible?

2024-03-14,1710428905,Psychological safety measure ,"So, im using Any Edmondsons measure on team psychological safety from her 1999 paper and I two questions: 

https://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/15341_Readings/Group_Performance/Edmondson%20Psychological%20safety.pdf

1. For an individual respondent across the 7 items did she just sum their score or find the average? Im presuming she found the individual average and then combined with other respondents/ team averages? 

2. Secondly, I dont see where she places a boundary on those values e.g. a score of 4 being a poor/medium level of psychology safety.
Could anyone point me in the right direction here please :) ",IOPsychology,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/1benef4/psychological_safety_measure/

2024-03-10,1710079623,Types of IO jobs? ,"Good morning! 

Im 54 years old and have been an IT/Systems Business Analyst and Project Manager for going on 20 years. Ive been burned out for a while though and seeking to change career paths. I was going toward trauma counseling and was applying to MSW programs, but I came across IO Psychology. 

Many many years ago I was at a large companys all day new hire orientation, and a speaker got up who introduced herself as an organizational psychologist. Many of the things she said grabbed my attention and I remember thinking, that seems like a really cool career, and maybe I could help people in that way someday. 

She was a consultant, which is what Id eventually like to be, but Im guessing most folks dont start out like this? Im wondering about IO career paths and job titles. Internships or part-time roles while in school, entry level jobs, short-term consultancies, please tell me about any and all of it. Id love to hear about your job titles, your paths, even your goals for the future. I did look at SIOPs career track and Id like to aim for Expert Consultant but not yet sure how to get there. Once I get into grad school I plan to join SIOP as a student. 

Ill add that I have a BA in Humanities and various IT certifications. Im pursuing this because Im convinced that I can leverage my corporate/industry experience and combine it with my interest in helping people plus my love of psychology. IO Psych seems like the fastest and most effective way to work in the space between orgs and people to help meet the needs of both - is that statement correct? I understand that you are working for organizations, theyre the ones paying for your services. 

I would also like to work specifically for the oil and gas industry if possible because thats what Im very familiar with, but I think I Ill take what I can get for starters. What industries do you find are the most interesting to work in or are the most in need of IO services? 

Ive applied to the one year Angelo State online program. Theyve never actually graduated anyone yet, its very new. Accelerated intense program, no thesis or internship necessary. I had a long phone conversation with the program head on Friday afternoon to make sure my goals aligned with their program and it seems that they do, and she said theyd love to have me. 

Im realizing that a lot of these types of questions have already been answered elsewhere so Ill scroll back and do some reading. Apologies for redundancy. 

Ill also add that Ive done some Change Management work and currently working on Lean Six Sigma Certification. Hopefully these will help? 

Finally, do any of you teach adjunct or are you professors? 

Thanks for your input and guidance. ",IOPsychology,11,https://www.reddit.com/r/IOPsychology/comments/1bbb56v/types_of_io_jobs/
